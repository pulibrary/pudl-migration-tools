# Migrating Historical Postcard collection (pudl0009, ac045)
*The problem:* Like Western Americana (WC054, WC055): there is an EAD for the collection, with <ead:c> containers for each postcard,  and a METS/MODS record for every verso/recto.  Each <ead:c> has an id and a bit of metadata (unittitle, unitdate), but no other information that could link it to the corresponding METS/MODS data.
